HW 21
## For this homework, I did some analysis, summarization, and reccomendation for the company that develops Adderall.
### To start, I had a few research papers that I used a T5 summarization model to summarize the findings of.

The findings can be summarized in that Adderall is a drug taht has a worryingly dangerous black market, with hihg potential for abuse and psychological dependencies.

After seeing this, I thought it might be best to see what the people think. I then took a plethora of reviews of the drug and ran them through a T5 sentiment model to see what everyone thought. Strangely enough, old women and less surprisingly, what I assume is the mothers of hyperactive 7 year old boys, love the drug.

After this observation, I thought it best to create some art that can help the company market their drug to the desired demographic using StableDiffusion.

I also suggested a whole rebrand. Here are some names that ChatGPT came up with:

SageSight: Emphasizing wisdom and clarity for older women.
TranquilTune: A calming name appealing to young boys under 8.
MindMender: Focused on improving concentration for both demographics.
ClariCalm: Evoking clarity and tranquility, suitable for older women.
BrightBuddy: Highlighting mental clarity and focus, appealing to younger boys.

I'm a personal fan of SageSight. Let's get a logo for it.
